      objective: "Llegeix cada frase i tria la paraula correcta: <strong>under</strong>, <strong>below</strong> o <strong>beneath</strong>.",
      explanation: [
         "<strong>under</strong> s‚Äôutilitza quan una cosa est√† just a sota d‚Äôuna altra, ja sigui en contacte o no, per√≤ dins la seva projecci√≥ directa (com si en reb√©s l‚Äôombra). Exemple: <em>I'm standing under the balcony</em> ‚ûù estic just a sota i el balc√≥ em cobreix; si plou, no em mullo.",
         "<strong>below</strong> s‚Äôutilitza per parlar d‚Äôalguna cosa que est√† m√©s avall, per√≤ no necess√†riament directament a sota. Hi pot haver despla√ßament lateral. Exemple: <em>The street is below the balcony</em> ‚ûù est√† en un nivell inferior, per√≤ no exactament sota el balc√≥.",
         "<strong>under</strong> tamb√© apareix en moltes expressions fixes com: <em>under control</em>, <em>under pressure</em>, <em>under the law</em>, etc., amb significat figurat de ‚Äòsubjecte a‚Äô o ‚Äòafectat per‚Äô.",
         "<strong>below</strong> ‚ûù s‚Äôutilitza tamb√© per a valors, nivells, o posicions (temperatures, percentatges, textos, etc.).",
         "<strong>beneath</strong> ‚ûù similar a <em>under</em>, per√≤ m√©s formal o literari; pot suggerir un significat figurat o emocional. Exemple: <em>beneath the surface</em>, <em>beneath his smile</em>."
