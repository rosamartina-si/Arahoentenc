      objective: "Choose the correct word: <strong>nowhere</strong>, <strong>somewhere</strong>, <strong>anywhere</strong>, or <strong>everywhere</strong>.",
      explanation: [
        "<strong>nowhere</strong> ➔ means ‘not in or at any place’. Used to express total absence (e.g., It's nowhere to be seen, You're going nowhere) and sometimes metaphorically (‘not progressing’).",
        "<strong>somewhere</strong> ➔ means ‘in some place’ or ‘to some place’. Examples: Somewhere else (in another place), I left it somewhere or other, somewhere near us (not far from us).",
        "<strong>anywhere</strong> ➔ means ‘in any place’. Often used in negative or interrogative sentences (e.g., We aren't going anywhere). In affirmatives, it can mean ‘wherever’ (e.g., He can go anywhere in the world).",
        "<strong>everywhere</strong> ➔ means ‘in all places’. Used in positive sentences to express ubiquity (e.g., There was sand everywhere)."
