  "explanation": [
    "<strong>nowhere</strong> ➔ ‘enlloc’. Expressa absència total (It's nowhere to be seen, You're going nowhere) i també s'usa en sentit figurat (‘no progressar’).",
    "<strong>somewhere</strong> ➔ ‘en algun lloc, en alguna (part / banda)'. (Somewhere else en algun altre lloc, I left it somewhere or other ho vaig deixar en un lloc o altre, somewhere near us prop de nosaltres, no gaire lluny de casa nostra).",
    "<strong>anywhere</strong> ➔ ‘a qualsevol lloc’. S'empra sobretot en frases negatives o interrogatives (We aren't going anywhere). En afirmatives pot significar ‘a qualsevol lloc del món’ / ‘pertot arreu’ (He can go anywhere in the world).",
    "<strong>everywhere</strong> ➔ ‘a tot arreu’ o ‘pertot arreu’. Indica presència universal en frases afirmatives (There was sand everywhere)."
