  "explanation": [
    "<strong>anywhere</strong> ➔ ‘a qualsevol lloc’. S'empra sobretot en frases negatives o interrogatives (We aren't going anywhere). En afirmatives pot significar ‘a qualsevol lloc del món’ / ‘pertot arreu’ (He can go anywhere in the world).",
    "<strong>nowhere</strong> ➔ ‘enlloc’. Expressa absència total (It's nowhere to be seen, You're going nowhere) i també s'usa en sentit figurat (‘no progressar’).",
    "<strong>everywhere</strong> ➔ ‘a tot arreu’ o ‘pertot arreu’. Indica presència universal en frases afirmatives (There was sand everywhere)."
